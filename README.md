This project is a small Raspberry Pi driven robot car with 3 infrared sensors and programmed to follow a wall and avoid collisions. This was CDP Technologies demo during the Robotex 2017, the biggest robot festival in Europe.
 
The demo comes with an HTML interface showing the sensor measurement and turn calculations in real-time in addition to allowing you to change speed and adjust parameters.

The demo was created using [CDP Studio](http://cdpstudio.com/home-edition).
